This Dataset contais historical data about the Titanic disaster. Our goal is to correctly predict, base on some features of the passengers, who will die and who will survive.

## PROJECT PLANNING 

1) Understand nature of the Data.
2) Histograms, Boxplots, Lineplots, Countplots, etc...
3) Value counts.
4) Missing data.
5) Correlation between the metrics.
6) Important themes:
	6.1) How many survived?
	6.2) Was gender an important factor?
	6.3) Was the class important?
	6.4) Was age important?
	6.5) How many were alone? How many had parents, siblings or children? Was that important?
	6.6) Were age and class related?
	6.7) What happened to the Captain?

7) Feature engineering.
8) Scaling.
9) Model Performance:
	9.1) Logistic Regression.
	9.2) Naive Bayes.
	9.3) Decision Tree.
	9.4) Random Forest.
	9.5) KNN.
	9.6) SVC Classifier.
	9.7) XGBoost Classifier.
	9.8) Voting Classifier.

10) Compare models.
11) Tune Hyperparameters for classification Machine Learning Algorithms.
12) Obtain results.
